Nsm - NDI Simple Monitor for Linux
==================================

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/k1aF4J0l.jpg)

**Nsm** is a small utility that receives a [NDI] video stream and simply show
it with a full screen view.

[NDI]: https://www.newtek.com/ndi/

I made this application simply because NewTek doesn't provide NDI Tools for
Linux platforms. I recommend using the official NDI Tools on other desktop
platforms (Windows/macOS).

System requirements
-------------------

- x86-64 based Linux system with Vulkan support

Installation
------------

Prebuild binaries are vailable from the [Releases] page.

[Releases]: https://github.com/keijiro/Nsm/releases

How to use
----------

- Select a NDI source from the drop-down menu.
- You can hide the drop-down menu by clicking an empty space of the screen.
  Click again to make the menu reappear.
